Implementing Random Forest by Multi-threading, Multi-processing and Distributed Computing
Contributors: Shyam Narasimhan and Ronak Shah

Here we explore the parallel implementation of Random Forest by Multi-threading, multi-processing and distributed computing.
Scikit-learn implements multi-threading. With few modifications, we were able to implement multi-processing.
Parallelizing across different nodes has been done using Dask framework, and also explored with Spark.
